            <p>When I get older, I want to start a career in financing and business. Specifically, I want to play with the stock market and get involved with trading stocks.  To achieve my goal, I will continue to take more of the engineering classes that Dublin High School offers and continue to make the most out of the engineering academy. Also, I will take business classes, like Integrated Marketing and Economic Business Ownership, and join DECA to better prepare me for my career. After graduating with my Engineering Diploma, I will go to the New York University to study Finance. This is my personal career choice because my dad buys and sells stocks himself, and he teaches me about the certain things involved around that business and how much potential money you could earn if you know what you're doing. By being apart of the engineering academy, I am able to learn a lot about the basic knowledge of technology and I can use that knowledge to invest in companies that I think will do good in the future </p>
            <p>Some skills that I have are persistence and dedication. For example, over the summer in the month of July, I would go to the gym every single day and practice basketball, trying to get better. I would practice hard so I could make a spot on the Varsity basketball team. When tryouts came, all of my hard work paid off. I ended up being the only Sophomore to make the Varsity basketabll team because of my hard work and dedication. My biggest achievement has to be maintaining a 4.0 GPA for my freshman and sophomore year of high school. This is my biggest achievement because I had to learn how to manage my time more efficiently. I was busy playing sports, spending time with friends and family, but I still found time to study and achieve all A's both years. One thing I learned about myself from participating in difficult classes is that I learned how to problem solve. Before entering high school, school came very easy to me as I was able to ace tests without studying. When I came to high school I found most classes to be rather challenging. Most of my classes require you to think and to actually work things out for yourself. Instead of having the teacher teach you the concepts, you have to figure out and problem solve to understand the prompts. </p>
            <p>Ever since I was young, I'd wanted to pursue a career in business. Some traits that will help me achieve my career is that I am persistent, dedicated, and I am a problem solver. Feel free to look around my website some more and even check out some of the projects that I have worked on. I want to thank you for reading about me and taking time out of your day to read it. </p>
