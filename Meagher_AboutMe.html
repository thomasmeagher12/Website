            <p>As of right now, I do not clearly have a vision for what I want to be when I grow up. But I always knew I was going to have a profession in the field of sports. As of this moment, my personal career goal is to work for an NBA basketball team as a data analyst. To achieve my goal, I will take most of the engineering classes that Dublin High School offers and continue to make the most out of the engineering academy. After graduating with my Engineering Diploma, I will go to the University of Duke to study mathematics and statistical science. This is my personal career choice because ever since I was a kid, working for an NBA team or working in a basketball-related environment has always interested me. Basketball is my main interest and I am very interested in statistics or math.</p>
            <p>Some skills that I have are persistence and dedication. For example, over the summer in the month of July, I would go to the gym every single day and practice basketball, trying to get better. I would practice hard so I could make a spot on the Varsity basketball team. When tryouts came, all of my hard work paid off. I ended up being the only Sophomore to make the Varsity basketabll team because of my hard work and dedication. My biggest achievement has to be receiving a 4.0 GPA for the freshman year of high school. This is my biggest achievement because I had to learn how to manage my time more efficiently. I was busy playing sports, spending time with friends and family, but I still found time to study and achieve all A's both semesters. One thing I learned about myself from participating in difficult classes is that I learned how to problem solve. For example, I was getting bad grades in my English class because I was too shy. Instead of continually receiving bad grades on Socratic Seminars, I problem solved, and practiced public speaking, and as a result I ended up bringing my grade back up. </p>
            <p>Ever since I was young, I have always had a knack for statistics and sports. Some traits that will help me achieve my career is that I am persistent, dedicated, and I am a problem solver. Feel free to look around my website some more and even check out some of the projects that I have worked on. I want to thank you for reading about me and taking time out of your day to read it. </p>
