            <h3>Project: MIT AppInventor Project</h3>
            <h3>Project Name: GeoGuesser</h3>
            <h3>Duration: September 19th - October 6th</h3>
            <h3>Course: Computer Science/Software Engineering</h3>
            <p>The objective of this project was to make a game using MIT AppInventor. My partner and I created a game where you would study a map of a location and answer questions that would relate to the map. As a team, each day we would assign a task to complete for the night. During the first week of the project, I was the one who was in charge of the project notebook. During the second week of the project, I would expand on our code and add more questions to our game. Throughout the process of making the game, our team ran into some obstacles. One obstacle we ran into was we did not know how to flip screens from the map to the question. We tried many different methods from shaking, to using a button, and using a timer, but we finally figured out a solution. Instead of adding anything to the game, we used the back button on the bottom bezel of the tablet. From this experience, we learned that when a code is not working the way we want, do not give up on your idea. We learned to think of different ways to solve the solution and to think outside the box.
